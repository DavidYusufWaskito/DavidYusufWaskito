# 🏄‍♂️About Me
## 🚀Introduction
Hi there! My name is David Yusuf Waskito and I'm currently studying computer science, programming, and game development at Amikom University in Sleman, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. I have a passion for learning and creating new things, especially in the field of programming.

## 💻Programming Languages
Currently, I am learning and working with C++ and Python programming languages. I find C++ to be particularly interesting and have been using it for most of my projects. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills, so I'm open to learning new programming languages in the future.

## ✨Interests
Aside from programming, I'm also interested in game development and design. I enjoy exploring new game mechanics and believe that games can be a powerful tool for storytelling and self-expression. I hope to create games that can inspire and entertain others in the future.

## ⚽Hobbies
In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, and watching movies or animes.

## 📞Contact
If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free to send me a message on Instagram or GitHub. I'm always happy to connect with other developers and collaborate on new projects.
